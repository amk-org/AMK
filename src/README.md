# Source code
Well, at this moment there is only several sample files here:

- a *.lex* file for flex
- a *.y* file for bison / yacc
- a *Makefile* file for make

And the default compiler is GCC.

Well, I have to confess the files have nothing to do with **amk**, they are just a calculator 
modified from a code online.

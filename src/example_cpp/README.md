# Source code
Well, at this moment there are only several sample files here (in directory *example* / *example_cpp* for C / C++ language):

- a *.lex* file for flex
- a *.y* / *.ypp* file for bison / yacc
- a *Makefile* file for make

And the default compiler is GCC.

Well, I have to confess the files have nothing to do with **amk**, they are just a calculator 
modified from a code online.
